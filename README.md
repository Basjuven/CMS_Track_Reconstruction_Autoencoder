# CMS Track Reconstruction Using a Linear Autoencoder
 "Implementation of a Linear Autoencoder for Particle Track Reconstruction in CMS Open Data"

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Linear Autoencoder for reconstructing particle tracks using data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN. The study aims to reduce noise and preserve essential features of high-dimensional track data for High Energy Physics (HEP) analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used is CMS Open Data from [CERN Open Data Portal](https://opendata.cern.ch/record/7730).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CMS-Track-Reconstruction-Autoencoder.git
   cd CMS-Track-Reconstruction-Autoencoder
